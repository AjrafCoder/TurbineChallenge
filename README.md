# Turbine Challenge

## Sharing your plan and approach (any notes before coding started)
The application should check if each number is divisable by 3,5 and a combination of both and print the output.

$i%3==0 means the number is divisible by 3

$i%5==0 means the number is divisible by 5

$i%5==0 && $i%3==0 means the number is divisible by both

##  Any future plans for how the application could be improved

The application could be improved by implementing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). It involves removing redundancy and duplication from the code.
